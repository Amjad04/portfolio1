        <h2> Types of E-C</h2>
        <p>There are four main types of ecommerce models that can describe almost every transaction that takes place between consumers and businesses.</p><br>
        <p>1. Business to Consumer (B2C):
            When a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer (e.g. You buy a pair of shoes from an online retailer)..</p>
        <p>2. Business to Business (B2B):
            When a business sells a good or service to another business (e.g. A business sells software-as-a-service for other businesses to use).</p>
        <p>3. Consumer to Consumer (C2C):
            When a consumer sells a good or service to another consumer (e.g. You sell your old furniture on eBay to another consumer).</p>
        <P>4. Consumer to Business (C2B):
            When a consumer sells their own products or services to a business or organization (e.g. An influencer offers exposure to their online audience in exchange for a fee, or a photographer licenses their photo for a business to use).</P><br>
        <P>Examples of Ecommerce
            Ecommerce can take on a variety of forms involving different transactional relationships between businesses and consumers, as well as different objects being exchanged as part of these transactions.</P><br>
        <P>1. Retail:
            The sale of a product by a business directly to a customer without any intermediary.</P>
        <P>2. Wholesale:
            The sale of products in bulk, often to a retailer that then sells them directly to consumers.</P>
        <P>3. Dropshipping:
            The sale of a product, which is manufactured and shipped to the consumer by a third party.</P>
        <P>4. Crowdfunding:
            The collection of money from consumers in advance of a product being available in order to raise the startup capital necessary to bring it to market.</P>
        <P>5. Subscription:
            The automatic recurring purchase of a product or service on a regular basis until the subscriber chooses to cancel.</P>
        <P>6. Physical products:
